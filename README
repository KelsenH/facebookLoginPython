facebookLoginPython

Simple script to log into facebook
It runs using selenium and a webdriver
I use the chromedriver which can be downloaded here:
	https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.27/
The path to the driver must be put into the code for it to run
Facebook loign credentials need to be input into the code as well
